--- Guide to CVFXBase source code by Plasmoxy ---

You need to have these files in your package :
    1. A class that extends CVFXApp
        - must set the fxml location with setFxmlLocation method in constructor (otherwise InvocationException is thrown at runtime)
        - must first load opencv
        - then you can start application with launch(args) method

    2. A class that extends CVFXController
        - must implement process method

    3. A .fxml gui file for the app
        => just copy the cvfxgui.fxml inside your project ( and load it's location in CVFXApp subclass )
        ( you are free to modify it as you need )

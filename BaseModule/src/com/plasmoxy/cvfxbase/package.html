    <b>This is Javadoc for my CVFXBase Java package.</b><br>
    <p>
        CVFXBase is an OpenCV JavaFX extensible application with various controls and
        3 views. It includes an interface for easy OpenCV programming. <br>
        I created it to quickly and easily setup a GUI and OpenCV renderer and focus on OpenCV logic.
